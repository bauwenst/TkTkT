      that you can take (e.g. a softmax over the vocab, although you lose mass because only a few of those are actually

    For Viterbi paths that maximise the score on the character boundaries they hit.

    If using log probabilities, hitting low probabilities is disproportionately punished. This is not the case for
    symmetric linear transforms, like [0,1] -> [-1,+1]. Note that even though such scores might resemble probabilities
    a lot, they should STILL be summed, not multiplied (as if they're still logarithms) when accumulated.

    Now, point models give a probability of each character having a split point after it or not.
    So why not use probabilities?

    We want a Viterbi path to accumulate as much of the probability mass as possible (hit all the predicted
    boundaries), but disincentivise cheating by oversegmenting. Let's say you sum across the boundaries you hit.
    Oversegmenting would then cause you to collect all boundary probability, without being punished for collecting 0s.
    Hence, it is better to use a linear transform like -1 + P*(1 - (-1)) = 2P-1: you are rewarded for stepping on a
    boundary and you are punished for stepping on a non-boundary.
    The alternative is to use multiplication, or equivalently to use logarithms, but beware that this gives outsized
    punishment to stepping on a non-boundary (a single non-boundary can make 20 boundary hits evaporate by multiplying
    by a very small number). This is also easy to see when you take the ln, where you are punished by -100 if you
    get it wrong but getting it right is an invisible +0.

    Furthermore, multiplying probabilities (summing logarithms) has some bias towards shorter token sequences.
    Picking up [START, 1, 1, 1, 0.99, END] is worse than picking up [START, 1, 1, 1, END] when you multiply, even though
    clearly the first is much better. In log space, you get -0 -0 -0 -0.000001 versus -0 -0 -0. This is why a probability
    transform and then summing instead of multiplying is worthwhile.

                scores.set(n,k, boundary_scores[n+k])  # Example: you are at n == 0. For k == 1, you take the second-smallest step, to 2. The probability of hitting a boundary by doing so is the probability of a boundary being after 1 == n+k.

    Uses point boundaries, assumed to be independent, to compute segment probabilities.
    Should still be used with sum accumulation.

    Let's say you have suggested splits abc|de|f. The probability of the segment "abc" is computed now not as
        P(boundary after char 2 | abcdef)
    but instead as
        P(boundary after char 2 | abcdef)*P(no boundary after char 1 | abcdef)*P(no boundary after char 0 | abcdef)

    This is exactly what is calculated when you use log scores (because the sum of the logs is the log of the product of
    the probabilities, and you get numerical stability as a bonus), so mathematically speaking, this should be the most
    accurate type of score, since maximising this objective maximises the joint distribution across all possible split points.
    Of course, when constraints are involved, this is no longer true.

    There's a funky equivalence here: you could convert the CharacterClassifier into a SubstringClassifier first, and
    then use that SubstringClassifier with its usual grid generator.

    TODO: As it turns out, for symmetric scores (not regular probabilities), this is mathematically equivalent to only considering chosen boundaries.
          Given the preferred score at position i, you can either choose to split there or not. You get the score at that position when you do.
            - If it's not a split and you do split, you receive a score, but it's negative.
            - If it's not a split and you don't split, you don't receive a score, which is +1 over the alternative decision.
            - If it's a split and you don't split, you don't receive a score.
            - If it's a split and you do split, you receive a score and it's positive, which is +1 over the alternative decision.
         In other words, when you DON'T SPLIT somewhere, the net reward of that decision doesn't have to be accounted for
         explicitly because it already was.
         The reason why this is different in the LogProbability class is because the ln(1-p) is not -ln(p) and hence if
         you add ln(1-p) as extra "negative reward", this is NOT equivalent to missing ln(p), unlike subtracting ln(p) would be.
         |
         I wonder what happens when you have asymmetric rewards. We want to incentivise precision (because you need smaller
         gains in precision to get bigger gains in F1), which means disencentivising (bad) splitting as much as possible.
         Right now, for the same word, it is equally scored to have
            - 2 good splits + 2 bad splits == 1 good + 1 bad.
            - 2 good splits + 1 bad splits == 1 good + 0 bad.
        In the second case, even though the net score is the same, the second one has better precision (and worse recall).
        It's not obvious that you want to lower recall, but in any case, either use a tiebreaker objective or punish bad
        splits more: with weight -2, you would get
            - +2 + -4 != +1 -2
            - +2 + -2 != +1 +0
        The obvious danger is of course that you won't go get a reachable split if it requires one bad split.
        |
        One more thing to prove: if you have this kind of negative reward, is it useful to count untaken splits, or is
        it again mathematically equivalent?
            - If it's not a split (carried score -2) and you do split, you receive -2.
            - If it's not a split (carried score -2) and you don't split, you receive +0 (boundary-only) or +2 (joint), so joint gives twice the benefit for being correct. Net +2 vs. net +4.
            - If it's a split (carried score +1) and you don't split, you receive +0 (boundary-only) or -1 (joint).
            - If it's a split (carried score +1) and you do split, you receive +1, so again joint just gives twice the benefit for being correct. Net +1 vs. net +2.
        There is also an alternative, keeping the positive and negative ranges fixed:
            - If it's not a split (carried score -2) and you do split, you receive -2.
            - If it's not a split (carried score -2) and you don't split, you receive +0 (boundary-only) or +1 (joint). Net +2 vs. net +3.
            - If it's a split (carried score +1) and you don't split, you receive +0 (boundary-only) or -2 (joint).
            - If it's a split (carried score +1) and you do split, you receive +1. Net +1 vs. net +3.
        In one, the net reward for being correct is doubled from boundary-only to joint.
        In the other, the net reward for a correct positive versus a correct negative is different (boundary-only) or the same (joint).
        |
        To figure out which of these two effects results in an equivalence between boundary-only and joint, you should
        implement both strategies and run all 4 variants. There are two ways to implement these asymmetric ranges:
            - Linear: min + P*(max-min)
            - Piecewise: (2*P-1)*max if P > 0.5 else (1-2*P)*min
        So actually, there are 8 variants that test 4 functions.

    """
    Combination of prefix and suffix scores.
        - When you don't start on a boundary and don't end on a boundary, you get punished.
        - When you do start on a boundary but don't end on a boundary, you get prefix score.
        - When you don't start on a boundary and do end on a boundary, you get suffix score.
        - When you do start on a boundary and do end on a boundary, there are two cases:
            - There is at least one boundary in between them: you get the sum of prefix and suffix.
            - There are no boundaries in between them: you get prefix or suffix (they are equal).
              The reason for doing this is so that every character is counted exactly once.

    You might say: in a string |ab|cdefg|, doesn't the token "bcdefg" get you the same score as "cdefg", since the
    suffix score for hitting the "g" is still the 5 you'd get for "cdefg"? Yes, HOWEVER, notice that "bcdefg" starts on
    "b" rather than "c", so you didn't get a suffix score for reaching "c".
    Thus, /a/bcdefg/ contributes 1 ("a" contains 1 starting character of "ab") + 5 ("bcdefg" contains 5 ending characters of "cdefg") = 6,
    whilst /ab/cdefg/ contributes 2 ("ab" match) + 5 ("cdefg" match) = 7.

    A slight correction is added: the decimal part of the score stores how many exact token matches have been made. This
    is to break the following two ties: we know the best segmentation gets you 7. However,
        - The segmentation /ab/cde/fg/ gets you 2 ("ab" match) + 3 ("cde" prefix of "cdefg") + 2 ("fg" suffix of "cdefg") = 7.
        - The segmentation /abcdefg/ gets you 2 ("abcdefg" contains 2 starting characters of "ab") + 5 ("abcdefg" contains 5 ending characters of "cdefg") = 7.
    In other words: you can split a good token in half or merge two tokens without seeing the difference. To counter this,
    an exact match gets an extra 0.01 as natural tiebreaker, hence the scores become
        - /ab/cdefg/ = 2.01 + 5.01 = 7.02
        - /ab/cde/fg/ = 2.01 + 3 + 2 = 7.01
