        Can be overridden to support other constructors, but this default will work for most languages.
        The reason for not having this method itself as the constructor is because it's bad design to expect subclasses
        to have the same interface for their __init__ method as the superclass. That's not what __init__ is for.

        appropriate values to those arguments, changing the interface for __init__ whilst keeping that of fromFiles stable.
