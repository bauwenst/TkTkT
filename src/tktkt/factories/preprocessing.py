    Same as the ModernEnglishPretokeniser, except it is compatible with tokenisers that process their input
    in the byte domain (which usually happens by running bytes(..., "utf-8") on every pretoken).

    The issue with these tokenisers is two-fold:
        1. They map pseudo-byte characters, which each represent an atom of the alphabet, into even finer atoms that
           then need to be learnt as units, which takes up vocabulary space in tokenisers like BPE.
        2. In addition, exactly because these tokenisers cannot have any other atoms than the 256 byte units, they also
           don't support treating multi-byte boundary markers (e.g. Sennrich's multi-character </w> or Roberta's Ġ) as whole units.

    The solution to both of these is to set up the string such that .encode() will produce both of the effects we want:
        1. Don't apply a pseudo-byte mapping. Without adding characters, that means .encode() performs the same mapping we want.
        2. We pick a character that is mapped to a single atom, make sure it is removed from all pretokens, and then use
           that as a boundary marker at the front or back of pretokens. This means .encode() will map it to a single byte
           that appears nowhere else, and hence we effectively have a boundary marker. Since we start with whitespace
           tokenisation, whitespace is a suitable choice for that character.

    """
    Variant that is better suited for training with the SentencePiece package, which has two pretokenisation constraints
    to take into account (similar to the constraints taken into account for the byte-compatible preprocessor):
        - All spaces are converted to a "_" boundary marker, so the boundary marker added by the preprocessor must be a space.
        - The byte mapping must be such that all non-ASCII pseudo-byte characters, i.e. the characters that don't represent
          themselves but represent bytes of larger characters, can be grouped into one token, which is only possible when
          they belong to the same Unicode script. This is not the case for the HuggingFace pseudo-byte mapping, which includes
          characters like ½ and ÷.

    Pretokens resulting from this pretokeniser should be concatenated with an exotic Unicode character from a script
    known to SentencePiece that will never be used, and then fed into a SentencePiece vocabulariser. Do NOT concatenate
    these with spaces.

    This pretokeniser actually has a more generalisable ordering than the normal ModernEnglishPretokeniser:
        1. Split into coarse pretokens that should receive a boundary.
        2. To each pretoken, add a character (front, back or in between) that (1) will not interfere with the rest of the
           subpretokenisers that follow and (2) has an invertible result when sent through the alphabet mapping of choice.
           In this case, it's a space character.
        3. Split into fine pretokens to inhibit the tokeniser.
        4. Apply the alphabet mapping. You now have no guarantee that any of your usual splitters still works, and in fact,
           in this pretokeniser, hyphen and apostrophe splitting won't work anymore, for example. The ModernEnglishPretokeniser
           does not take this into account and just assumes that the alphabet mapping keeps hyphens and apostrophes intact.
        5. Invert the image of space characters under this mapping, and replace it by your word boundary of choice. In
           the case of SentencePiece, it must be a space because the built-in preprocessor turns spaces into boundaries itself.

    ---

    A note on vocabulariser-specific preprocessors:
    In an ideal world (which we aren't far from), every vocabulariser respects pretokens EXACTLY, i.e. no substrings
    are vocabularised that aren't present in the pretokens (unless single characters), and thus we can select our
    preprocessor P1 before selecting our vocabulariser.

    Sadly, with bad vocabularisers, our hand is forced. We're forced to rewrite our preprocessor (say, P2) such that
    it results in a hopefully isomorphic pretoken space. Then, you basically have three choices:
    1. Use the vocabulary as-is (in B space) and use P2+B as the effective preprocessor, like in training.
        - If the inferencer is good: use P2 + B, a small extra preprocessor that models the vocabulariser's built-in (the B is forcibly added because the vocabulary is in B space).
        - If the inferencer is bad: somehow change your preprocessor to be able to use the vocabulary.
            - If this is the original inferencer (e.g. SP ULM): use P2.
            - If this is another inferencer (e.g. SaGe with ULM vocab): use either
                - P2 + B + BB2 in the input and inv(B2) + inv(BB2) in the output, or
                - P2 + P2B2 in the input and inv(B2) + inv(P2B2) + B in the output.
    2. Use the vocabulary as-is (in B space), but use P1+P1B+B during inference as effective preprocessor, unlike the P2+B in training.
        - If the inferencer is good: use P1 + P1B + B. There is some expectation that P1 + P1B is almost exactly equivalent to P2, which means P1B could look like inv(P1) + P2.
        - If the inferencer is bad:
            - If this is the original inferencer (e.g. SP ULM): use P1 + P1B.
            - If this is another inferencer (e.g. SaGe with ULM vocab): use either
                - P1 + P1B + B + BB2 in the input and inv(B2) + inv(BB2) in the output, or
                - P1 + P1B2 in the input and inv(B2) + inv(P1B2) + P1B + B in the output.
    3. Adapt the vocabulary to P1 and use P1 as your preprocessor. I.e.: effective preprocessor in training was P2+B, but in inference it's truly P1.
        - If the inferencer is good: use P1.
        - If the inferencer is bad: use P1 + P1B in the input and inv(B) + inv(P1B) in the output
    If you assume that you only use good inferencers (e.g. use SentencePiece to make BPE and TkTkT to infer BPE),
    OR that the only bad inferencer you use is the one that accompanies the vocabulariser (e.g. using SPM BPE), in
    both cases these would be the preprocessors to write (other than P1 and P2):
        1. Only B
        2. P1B and B
        3. Nothing, but to initially convert the vocabulary, you effectively need
           inv(B) + inv(P1B), which are expected to be the same as inv(B) + inv(P2) + P1 (with the caveat that you
           may need to keep track of whether there was a boundary marker, since P1 will always add a boundary marker even if there wasn't any).
           So really, P1B and B as well.
    It is only in (3) that you can actually use the alphabet of your pre-written preprocessor P1.
